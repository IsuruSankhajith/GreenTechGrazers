Project Title: GreenTec Grazers 

Overview:
This repository hosts the source code and documentation for an architectural project implemented using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL). AADL is a modeling language used for the analysis, specification, and implementation of real-time embedded systems. 

Key Features:

AADL Models: Comprehensive AADL models representing the system architecture, including components, connections, and properties.
Code Implementation: The implementation of the system based on the AADL specifications, ensuring consistency between the design and the actual code.
Documentation: Detailed documentation providing insights into the system architecture, design decisions, and usage instructions.
Folder Structure:

/models: AADL model files representing the system architecture.
/src: Implementation code corresponding to the AADL specifications.
/docs: Documentation files, including system architecture documentation and user guides.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the /docs folder for comprehensive documentation on the system architecture and design.
Explore the /models folder to view AADL models.
Review the /src folder for the corresponding code implementation.
